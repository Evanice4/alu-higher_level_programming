   >>> s = "Welcome to this blog"
   >>> type(s)
   <class 'str'>
   1234567899
   >>> s += ". Enjoy!"
   >>> print(s)
   Welcome to this blog. Enjoy!
    

     why does it matter and how differently does 
     Python treat mutable and immutable objects?

     How arguments are passed to functions and 
     what does that imply for mutable and immutable objects?
